## General Information
- CCMASD is for multi-SNP analysis in complex
diseases.
- Existing epistasis detection algorithms can only detect the interaction between two SNPs, or have the problem of heavy computational workload.
- To simultaneously detect the relationship  between SNPs (single SNP and multi-SNP combinations) and complex diseases,CCMASD method is proposed.
- CCMASD method comprises four algorithms: Iterative Exclusion of Compatible Samples Algorithm (IECS), Iterative Exclusion of Variables Algorithm (IEV), Sufficient Condition Conjunction Algorithm (SCC), Iterative Screening Method Based on Sufficient Condition Conjunction (ISSCC)..

## Features
- Strong recognition ability.
- Small amount of computation.


## Usage
How does one go about using it?
Provide various use cases and code examples here.
- Prepare the dataset of SNPs related to complex diseases.
- Preprocess the dataset using scripts or other methods.
- Download and install the desired software packages in R language.
- Refer to provided scripts or write your own scripts to select data and perform analysis.
- Save the analysis results to a file and interpret the results.
